HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a request made by a client (usually a web browser or an API client). These codes indicate the outcome of the request or provide information about the status of the server. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any categorization role. Here are some commonly used HTTP status codes:

1xx Informational
100 Continue: The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.
101 Switching Protocols: The requester has asked the server to switch protocols.
2xx Success
200 OK: The request was successful.
201 Created: The request was successful, and a resource was created.
204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request but there is no content to send.
3xx Redirection
301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to another location.
302 Found (or Moved Temporarily): The requested resource has been temporarily moved to another location.
304 Not Modified: The client's cached copy is still valid, and there is no need to send a new request.
4xx Client Errors
400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request.
401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
5xx Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating a server failure.
501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request.
